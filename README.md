# electrical-Billing-system-using-design-patterns
<br>
this was my semester project.in this project, I have used three design patterns (factory design pattern, null object pattern, and composite pattern).
And to save the customer record I have used a file system.
admin username: an
admin password: a
admin can add customers  based on commercial and residential,  and calculate customer bills (both types of customers residential and commercial have different bill calculations)
customer can also login and view his bill which is generated by admin.
